# R Code - Bike-Sharing Rental Project

The purpose of this report is to examine how much these different independent
variables contribute to the hourly amount of bike-sharing rental users. Also, we are
interested if users pay attention more to the true temperature of the hour or the feeling
temperature of the hour. We hypothesize that there are going to be several of the same
variables that make up the causality of both amounts of casual and registered users.
Furthermore, the true temperature will have a higher causality effect on the dependent
variables than the feeling temperature. Throughout this report, we will be analyzing this
data to see whether or not our hypotheses are correct.
